## Personal Website

This repository is one mono-repo containing two projects: a **react-app** containing the landing page, about and contact information and my portfolio, and a **blog** Hugo app containing my blog. The entire thing is hosted on Vercel, and linked together with routing.

Right now, the Hugo site uses the PaperMod theme. I will eventually create my own Hugo theme that matches the theme of my website.
