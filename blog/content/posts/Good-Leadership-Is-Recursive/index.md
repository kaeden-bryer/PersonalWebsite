I want to take some time to journal about leadership. I never would've considered myself a "leader" up until college, but now I'm leading two organizations, Men's Volleyball and GrizzHacks. I take both very seriously too, and I even think I do a pretty good job. I want to journal about some of the things I'm doing right, some of the things I've learned were wrong, and some of my biggest lessons over the last 2 years about leadership.



The first lesson is that **Good leadership is recursive**. A recursive function is a function that calls itself over and over until it reaches some base case, and then returns answers upwards until they reach the root. A common implementation of recursion are *divide and conquer algorithms*.


Consider the merge sort algorithm. You start with an unsorted group of numbers, and tell one person to sort one half, and another to sort the other half. Then, each of those two people tell two other people to each sort one half. Eventually, every person will only have to sort one number, so they complete their task. The person above then compares the two numbers given to them, and sorts them by taking the lowest on each side. Then that person returns their two numbers to the person above him, who can easily sort all 4 numbers by crossing off the lowest between two sides one at a time. This continues until the person at the top gets two arrays sorted low to high, and crosses off the lowest between the two halves one at a time until they have the entire group of numbers, now sorted.

I've learned that this is, not coincidentally, what good leadership looks like. ***Good leadership follows a divide and conquer algorithm.***

I used to always fall into the pitfall of doing everything myself, and then remarking at the outcome and considering it good leadership. My reasoning was that as long as the outcome was good, the person in charge must be a good leader. However, this just doesn't scale. Eventually, I could only do so much, and when I failed to delegate, everything crumbled. I've also seen other people I really respect do this. I respect them greatly, but in retrospect, that was because they were incredibly capable, not because they were great leaders.



There's this thing called the Master's Theorem, which tells you how fast a recursive algorithm will run. Imagine dividing up your work by splitting it in half each layer down so that it becomes an upside-down "algorithm tree". There are three possible outcomes for your algorithm tree: it's root-heavy, leaves-heavy, or balanced. Root-heavy leadership happens when the leader tries to assume too much of the work themselves. Leaves-heavy leadership happens when too much work is delegated to the leaves. Unsurprisingly, these are both sub-optimal outcomes. Your algorithm is maximally efficient when the roots and leaves are equally balanced, meaning the brunt of the work is delegated evenly across the tree.

Now that I'm learning computer science, this feels like the best analogy I can describe for good leadership. Just because I'm doing lots of work and kept busy, that doesn't mean we are getting the most done as a team. Also, "divide and conquer" isn't just dividing up tasks evenly between everyone. Continuing with the analogy, the completion of tasks is only the base case, but the *merge step* (returning tasks upwards) is where work really gets done.


So I've learned to not only split work up, but to focus on doing it well. At three levels, maybe the top level will steer the goals of the team. Then, the goals are given to the team leads (level two), who will plan tasks for achieving these goals. Finally, these tasks are delegated to everyone else, who will individually complete these tasks.


And this is only possible when leaders are future-sighted, letting members work on individual tasks and not getting too involved in the here and now. But I'll journal about future-sighted leadership another time.
