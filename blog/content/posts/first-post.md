The passage of time is sneaking up on me. I'm now 20 years old. Whereas pre-college each year was easy to separate because I was growing in body and brain, I'm now reaching a point where I'm not going to become noticeably smarter each year, only more knowledgeable. My intelligence and personality have hit a point where they may remain for the foreseeable future. And this is disorienting, because this is the first time in my life this has happened. 



2 years have passed since I started journaling, and it doesn't even feel that way. My writing hasn't noticeably improved, nor my thinking drastically changed. Lots of it has remained the same. And this is the truth I have to grapple with: it's going to stay that way unless I make an active effort to improve upon it.



And for 2 years now I've always wanted to start a blog but never did. I think I was waiting until I became smarter, or more qualified to share my thinking with others. Now I realize that's not going to happen for a long time. So I've decided to pivot.



Instead, I want this blog to document my process so that you can \*grow with me\*. To follow my journey and see the steps I've taken-- that way you can learn from the lessons that have crossed me. I'm not an expert, and I'm not a special case or shining example to be raised on a podium. Rather, I'm quite normal and that's where my lessons come from.



Another big thing I want this blog to be about is \*just doing things\*. Being unafraid and beating perfectionism--doing things even if there's fear of doing things wrong. It's easier to change directions when you're moving than standing still. If something is amiss, I'll learn quicker by beginning than ruminating on the possibilities.



Reaching this age also means there's some things I'll only be able to do now, and never again. For example, I'm only going to lose athleticism from here on out. Unless I train, I'm not going to become more athletic anymore. If I want to excel in a sport, this is the last chance I'll get at it.



This is also the only time I can fully experience my college years. What am I going to do about that?



There are other things I can focus on, like getting a high paying job or beginning my climb up the corporate ladder. Yes, this is the time to get that headstart. But this is also one of those things that I can always go back to later in my life.



I think that's my problem with hustle culture--it narrows your vision to all the things you're missing now. This is a time in my life I'll never be able to revisit. What am I going to do about that?



Or how about love? Love will always be there as well, but not as it will be in your twenties. This is the only time me and my girlfriend will be unencumbered by jobs, payments, chores and kids. This is the time I have to take it all in--our youth, in full bloom.



I want to realize certain experiences now, because if I wait too long they'll be gone. 2 years have passed since I started journaling. It happened in the blink of an eye, and it will happen again. Now is the time experience those things.



Life will be waiting. You will be okay. Don't fret preparing for a future that is inevitable yet uncertain. Furiously do the things you love and can only do today.



That's the kind of blog I want this to be.
