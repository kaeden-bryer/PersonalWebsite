It's time to face it—I feel like journaling is the one part of myself I consistently lie about. It's the one thing I tell people I do, which in reality I fail to more often than not. It's true, I used to journal a lot, and it's done me lots of good. It's even true that I actually enjoy journaling when I finally get around to it. I just struggle to get around to doing it and sticking to it.

It's weird because it's something I desperately wish I was consistent and good about doing, and it's something I actually enjoy doing, yet I don't for some reason. Man can will what he wants, but man cannot will what he wills. Not sure if that makes sense in this context because it's something I want but I like that quote.

For future me—today was Michigan 2025 DevFest. I'm inspired to work on all sorts of projects, including my personal website, a Gemini-powered volleyball stats tracker, and finally hooking up Supabase to my Valentines website. I'd like to do all of these things by the end of this week, and possible more too. For example, I want to play around with Vue by making another About Me website, and then the Holiday Drinks Anthology in Vue. I want to practice C# and .NET again. I want to make a website for the Oakland Volleyball team. I want to watch more videos by Olivier Larose, follow his tutorials and make a sweet mockup of the GrizzHacks website. There's so much I want to do.

## Coding projects:

1. Personal Website and Blog
2. CV Volleyball Stats Tracker
3. Implement database for Valentines site
4. About Me (in Vue)
5. OUCVB Website
6. GrizzHacks Website

It's nice to journal because I can sit down and reflect on my current direction. But I think I struggle to commit because I want to commit to journaling every single day, and I know I can't do that, so I don't commit at all. I used to be very good about just journaling as often as I could, and then slowly increasing the amount I journaled until it was everyday. That's what I need to do again. 

I can't keep telling people I journal every night to reconsider my life direction if I don't actually do so. It's just lying. I can't keep telling people I want to start a personal website and not doing it, because it's been years.

I read the pamphlet Atomic Object gives out at Career Fairs today, which turns out to be just a collection of blog posts from The Atomic Spin. It made me realize how much I miss journaling, and that I could absolutely write similar content (and that I even have a desire to). I want to write about lessons I've learned about leadership, organization, motivation and coding. I want to reflect on the current industry, and how soft skills like communication and adaptability matter more than ever. 

This isn't me being angry with myself, it's just a plea to myself: please start journaling again, so you don't have to lie anymore. It's not even something I don't want to do.
