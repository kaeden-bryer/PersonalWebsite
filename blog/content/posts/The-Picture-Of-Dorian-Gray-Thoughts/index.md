The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a novel I've wanted to read since 13, but only just now finished at 22. The book is chilling, yet presents a beautiful analysis of what does (or doesn't) fulfill ones life, and the weight of the sins one must live with.

The book is centered around Dorian's character development. Dorian begins as an innocent boy, accidentally makes a Faustian bargain to remain eternally beautiful, and pursues a life of pleasure and aestheticism that ultimately becomes his own downfall. Despite making the perfect crime against Basil Hallward, Alan Campbell and Sibyl Vane, he's never caught by anyone and eventually commits murder against himself. I think it's intentional that Dorian Gray is never caught by anyone. There's a message in his guilt being the true source of his anguish, eventually leading to his own suicide. Even if he could escape others, he could never escape his own sins.

Below is an abridged summary of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Be warned of major spoilers.

## Summary

The Picture of Dorian Gray opens with Basil Hallward and Lord Henry in a garden. Basil tells Lord Henry about this new man he's met who's transformed his own art, such that everything he paints seems to have him in it. This intrigues Lord Henry, who asks to meet this person. Coincidentally, Dorian Gray arrives to sit for Basil's painting. Begrudgingly, Basil tells Lord Henry not to spoil Dorian's innocence, to which Lord Henry remarks he would never (he does).

After sitting for a couple hours, Dorian requests a break. Dorian and Harry walk out to the garden, and Lord Henry begins to seize Dorian's soul and alter its figure. He tells Dorian about the ultimate power of beauty, and that ones beauty is the greatest thing they can have, and a life full of pleasure the one thing worth living. Dorian absorbs it all like a violin, reacting to every touch of the bow. When he goes to sit again, he's a changed person.

Basil finishes his painting of Dorian, and it's beautiful. He finally spins it around, but instead of being happy, Dorian reacts unexpectedly: he cries out, "Why is life so cruel that I should grow old, but this painting stay forever young? Oh how I wish it could be the other way around!". He refuses to take the painting, and leaves. Basil (correctly) blames this on Lord Henry.

Lord Henry invites Dorian to a dinner together. The entire time Lord Henry is spinning paradoxes and contradictions in the air, catching them again and reversing their meanings. Dorian is entranced. After dinner, Dorian pleas that they spend more time together. His mind is beginning to be poisoned, and it desperately wants more of this poison he's becoming addicted to.

As a reader, one can only wonder—is who Dorian becomes Lord Henry's fault? Or did he simply unlock a part of Dorian that was laying dormant inside him? Did Lord Henry change Dorian, or is this who Dorian was all along?

Dorian decides to escape his aristocratic life for a night, and wanders into the streets of a more dangerous part of town one night. He finds a tawdry theater, but something about it calls to him. It's thoroughly second rate, but there he discovers the most beautiful, raw, talented actress in Sibyl Vane playing Juliet. He falls in love for the first time. He goes every night to watch her perform, and eventually, they meet each other backstage and vow to get married. In Dorian's words, "I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth"

He invites Lord Henry and Basil to watch her perform. She's absolutely awful that night. He is mortified in front of his friends after talking so greatly of her, and the entire theater leaves before the end of Act 3.

Dorian goes backstage to find Sibyl to inquire what's wrong. She gleams in response, "Nothing is wrong—can't you see why I acted so badly? Why I should never act well ever again?" Sibyl explains that she's so deeply in love with Dorian that finally she sees this acting life for all that is fake, and that none of the love she embodies can compare to the love she has for him. Dorian is umoved. He replies that before she used to excite him, but now she doesn't even interest him. He declares he wants nothing to do with her ever again, and leaves her clawing at his heels.

That night, Dorian goes back to his room pondering the events of that evening, when he happens across his picture. However, the picture has changed. It's become more cruel--just slightly, but unquestionably altered. His heart drops as he realizes that maybe, just possibly, his outcry came true. Somehow his picture was changing, and yet he would remain young and beautiful forever. He goes through many phases of revelation, but eventually settles on making amends with Sibyl, telling her he was wrong, and marrying her. That way, his soul would remain beautiful and lose its crooked smile.

He finds out the next morning that Sibyl has committed suicide.

Dorian is devastated, and in the confusion blames Sibyl for her suicide. He blames her for dying, because now he can't make amends anymore and everything was supposed to be good after he visited her. Lord Henry (who is over for this) suggests they go have dinner, watch an opera and forget about the whole thing. He convinces him that her suicide is the ultimate romantic gesture, and that her death was more beautiful than any other death she could have died. He gives him a book on Hedonism, which Dorian reads furiously. As a result, Dorian changes. He decides that he should live his most pleasureful life, and his painting should bear all his sins.

At this point, there's a long time skip spanning 18 years where Dorian pursues all the aesthetic wonders of the world. He buys exotic musical instruments, purchases numerous aromas and becomes obsessed with gemstones and visual wonders. Oscar Wilde flexes paragraph upon paragraph of aesthetic goods, which becomes awfully slow to read. However, I believe this was his intent. Dorian spends these next 18 years pursuing the aesthetic highs the world has to offer, but all together they begin to slurry. His experiences don't become marked or unique, and each pleasure becomes increasingly dulled to his senses, even though to the outside viewer his life is grandiose and idyllic.

18 years pass, and Dorian is now 38. He runs into Basil Hallward by chance, and invites him in to his house. At this point, Dorian is a completely different person. He's confident in his sins and pleasures, and stands for his own lifestyle. Basil confronts Dorian about the rumors he's heard, the rumors that Dorian has been corrupting many brilliant men in English society and ruining women left and right. Dorian shrugs these accusations off. Basil says that he just can't believe that they're true, that ones face would give them away, and yet Dorian has the face of someone who's innocent. He remarks that if they are true, then only God himself would be able to see into ones soul and know.

For some reason, this sends Dorian over the edge. Dorian exclaims that if Basil wants to see his soul, then he should follow him. He brings Basil to the abandoned study upstairs where his painting is stored, and reveals his hideous, crooked soul to Basil. Basil is aghast. He remarks that this can't be, then changes and tells Dorian that he must start praying and that it's not too late to become a good person. Dorian, for some reason, is suddenly filled with boredom and hatred for Basil. He grabs a nearby knife and stabs him in the neck, and in seconds his body is limp and filled with death.

Dorian invites a brilliant chemist, Alan Campbell, over to dispose of the body. Alan wants nothing to do with it, and says anything that happens to Dorian would be entirely deserved, and he wishes for it even. Dorian writes something down on a piece of paper and slides it over to Alan Campbell. Campbell is shocked, and suddenly agrees to dispose of the body. It can only be inferred that Dorian blackmailed Campbell with revealing him to be a homosexual, a grave crime at the time that would've ruined his career.

And yet, Dorian is haunted by Basil's death. Even though it's the perfect crime, he can't help but feel the weight of his sins. He escapes to a sailor brothel to do opium, when he runs into James Vane, Sibyl's brother, completely by chance. James follows Dorian into an alleyway, pushes him against a wall and presses a gun to his head and threatens to murder him for what he did to Sibyl. Dorian cleverly asks James how long ago the event happens. James responds '18 years ago'. Dorian then asks James to illuminate his face with a lantern, revealing the boyish face of someone barely over 20. James apologizes for his rash behavior, and leaves Dorian to escape. It's only until after he's gone that James learns that that really was Sibyl's lover all along.

Dorian hosts a party at his country residence, Selby Royal. There, while hunting a rabbit, a man accidentally shoots another man in the chest. Dorian feels this is a premonition, and decides to leave. It's only when he's about to leave that he hears it was a sailor that was killed, immediately catching his attention. Dorian demands to see the body, and when the dead body of James Vane is finally revealed, he feels immense relief and happiness for himself.

In his last moments, Dorian Gray is having Lord Henry over. He announces that his life of wicked is over, and that he will now use his life for good. He doesn't tell Harry, but he tells himself that he'll change his ways, and heal his picture of all its wickedness. Lord Henry is disappointed that his Hedonistic experiment is coming to an end, and tells Dorian that his actions now aren't good or charitable. Dorian dismisses these remarks, and when he leaves, is feeling much better about himself. He goes to visit is portrait, thinking that perhaps already the picture is looking a little less evil.

He's wrong. Contrarily, the picture is even more bloody and crooked than ever before. He's overwhelmed with anguish and decides to finally destroy the picture, for even the pleasure he gained seeing the picture take on his sins brings him nothing but sorrow anymore. He grabs the same knife that killed Basil, and stabs the portrait.

The police hear a scream, and break into his house from above. What they find is a beautiful picture of their master, and an aged, degraded man with a knife before it. They recognize only from the rings he is wearing that the man is Dorian Gray.
