title = 'Programming is an Endless Rabbit Hole'
+++

It feels like the world of programming is just an ever-expanding field of things I don't know. Whenever I learn one thing, I discover 10 more things I don't know. It blows my mind how more experienced developers know all the things they know, and it feels like I might never get to that point.



Yet, when I look back at how much I knew 2 years ago, I'm astounded with the amount I know now. I think 2 years ago I didn't even know what VSCode was yet. I wouldn't say I know a lot, but I know basic programming, how to use VSCode, Git and GitHub, and at least understand several concepts I don't understand (like cloud, devops, networking, etc).



I feel so empowered now that I'm familiar with computers. I was able to set up a free, personal blog using Hugo in a day. I'm able to find and use free, open-source tools on GitHub and Docker (like LinkWarden), greatly enhancing my productivity. I'm comfortable with what AI is and isn't able to provide me, and how to use it to not just code but learn how to code. Which is to say, I feel like a complete beginner, but one that knows what to learn and how.



There's just so, freaking much to learn, it's ridiculous. It's because everything, at the end of day, is 1's and 0's fed to the computer. As a result, humans have created abstraction upon abstraction of these 1's and 0's in the form of new tools, languages, frameworks and libraries, resulting in an endless rabbit hole of things to learn. And it's like, what's the best way to pick which things to learn and how? Should I just keep following tutorials and making projects with the help of AI, and learn as I go? Or should I follow a course or book and reduce the amount of hands-on experience I gain in exchange for more knowledge?



I'm writing now because I want to carry this habit on, and two nights in a row it's gotten too late and I've dismissed journaling. This is my demonstration to myself saying "Hey, you don't have to journal at night when you risk putting it off. You can do it anytime during the day".



For the same reason, I'm going to throw this on my blog. It will almost certainly be removed later, but I severely don't want to get into the habit of not posting on my blog because "it's not ready yet".
